# Depth-First Search (DFS) and Depth-First Traversal

DFS is a method for exploring a tree or a graph - you go as deep as possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one

DFS is like walking through a corn maze, you explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one
