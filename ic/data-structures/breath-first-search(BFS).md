# Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal

BFS is a method for exploring a tree or graph. in a BFS, you first explore all the nodes on step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc

Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond, the nodes you explore "ripple out" from the starting point

**in a tree, you visit all the immediate children before going to the next child**

### Advantages

- a BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node

### Disadvantages

- a BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS
