/**
 * Find a duplicate, Space Edition™ BEAST MODE

In Find a duplicate, Space Edition™, we were given an array of integers where:

the integers are in the range 1..n1..n
the array has a length of n+1n+1
These properties mean the array must have at least 1 duplicate. Our challenge was to find a duplicate number, while optimizing for space. We used a divide and conquer approach, iteratively cutting the array in half to find a duplicate integer in O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time and O(1)O(1) space (sort of a modified binary search).

But we can actually do better. We can find a duplicate integer in O(n)O(n) time while keeping our space cost at O(1)O(1).
