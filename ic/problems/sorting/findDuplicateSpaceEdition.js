/**
 * Find a duplicate, Space Editionâ„¢.

We have an array of integers, where:

The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
The array has a length of n+1n+1
It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array. (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)

input: array
output: number
constraints: optimize for space!
edge cases: empty array

/*
1. find the number of integers in the input array
2. compare that to the number of possible unique integers in the same range
3. if the number of actual integers is greater than the number of possible integers, we know that there is a dupliate in the range
4. if the number of actual integers is not grater than the number of possible integers, we know there must be duplicate in the range n/2 + 1 ... n
5. at some point, our range will contain just 1 integer which will be our answer
