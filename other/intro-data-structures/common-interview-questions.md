## Common Interview Questions

### Stack & Queue
- use an array to implement 3 stacks
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/k-stacks-one-array-prompt
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/k-stacks-one-array-solution
- implement a getMin() or getMax() method on your stack
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/min-stack-prompt
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/min-stack-solution
- create a queue using 2 stacks
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/queue-two-stacks-prompt
  - https://repl.it/@bgando/queue-two-stacks-solution
- sort a stack with the min values in order, on top. you can use another stack as a buffer *(similar to Tower of Hanoi question)*

### Linked List
- delete the following
  1. a node in the middle of the linked list
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-middle-of-linked-list/
  2. a node with only a variable pointing at that node
