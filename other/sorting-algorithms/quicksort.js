/*
quicksort is a fast-sorting algorithm that runs under the time-bound O(n log n)

quick sort splits the array into two halves around a value called a pivot, and the partition subroutine will return this pivot value and split will be called on the left and the right halves

this will partition (or split) the array into 2 sections 
all values <= (less than) the pivot will be on the left and all values > (greater than) the pivot in the right half
