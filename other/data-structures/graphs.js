/* 
Graphs are non-linear data structures 
a graph is a system in which there are potentially multiple ways to get from an arbitrary point, A, to another arbitrary point, B

A graph is normally defined as a pair of sets (V,E). V is a set of arbitrary objects called vertices or nodes, and E is a set of pairs of vertices, which we call edges or (more rarely, arcs)

graph traversal (or graph search) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph

to visit each node or vertext which is a connected component, tree based algorithms are used -- you can do this easily by iterating through all the vertices of the graph, performing the algorithms on each vertex that is still unvisted when examined
